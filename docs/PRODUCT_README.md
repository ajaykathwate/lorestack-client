## What is Lorestack?

Lorestack is a **hybrid publishing platform** — open for anyone to write (like Medium or Dev.to) with a strong company knowledge-hub layer (unlike anything else). Three user types coexist:

- **Solo Author** — writes independently, no company required. Zero setup.
- **Company Author** — writes under a company brand they have been invited to join.
- **Company Owner** — creates and manages a company profile, invites authors, controls all company content.

The agency use case is also built-in: the Lorestack team can ghost-write and schedule articles for founder clients, who approve them before publishing (Complete Product phase).

## Roles & Permissions (RBAC)

Roles are **not selected at signup**. They emerge from actions taken on the platform.

### Role Acquisition

| How                                | Role Gained                       |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Any registration                   | `Independent Author` by default   |
| User creates a company             | `Company Owner` for that company  |
| User accepts a company invite      | `Company Author` for that company |
| Manually set in Supabase dashboard | `Platform Admin`                  |

### Key Rules

- A user can hold **multiple roles simultaneously** — e.g. Independent Author + Owner of Company A + Author in Company B.
- Roles are **additive** — gaining Company Owner does not remove Independent Author capability.
- `Company Owner` role is **non-transferable** in MVP.
- `Platform Admin` is set manually in Supabase dashboard — never via the app UI.

### Permissions Matrix

| Permission                            | Independent Author | Company Author   | Company Owner    | Platform Admin |

> `PermissionChecker` is a pure class with zero I/O dependencies that encodes all these rules. Every service method calls it before any write. There are no inline permission checks scattered across the codebase.

## MVP Features

**27 features across 9 domains. These are the only features in scope for Phase 1 (MVP).**

---

### 1. Authentication

#### 1.1 User Registration — Email & Password

Any visitor creates a Lorestack account using email and password via Supabase Auth. No role is selected at signup.

**Form fields:** Full Name (required), Email (required), Password (required, min 8 chars), Confirm Password (required).

**Flow:**

- On success → Supabase sends verification email → user redirected to "Check your inbox" screen.
- User clicks verification link → redirected to 2-field onboarding screen.
- Onboarding complete → user lands on dashboard with 3 empty-state CTAs: "Write your first blog", "Create a company", "Explore articles".

**Edge cases:**

- Email already registered → inline error: "An account with this email already exists."
- Password < 8 chars → inline error.
- Passwords do not match → inline error.
- Verification link expired (> 24 hours) → error page with "Resend verification email" button.
- Verification link already used → error: "This link has already been used."

---

#### 1.2 User Login — Email & Password

Registered users log in with email and password.

**Key behaviours:**

- "Remember me" checkbox for persistent session.
- 5 consecutive failed attempts → account locked for 15 minutes.
- On success → user redirected to their dashboard.

**Edge cases:**

- Email not found → "No account found with this email address."
- Wrong password → "Incorrect password."
- Email not verified → toast with "Resend verification email" link shown below.
- Account suspended → "Your account has been suspended. Contact support."

---

#### 1.3 Google OAuth Login — via Supabase

One-click sign-up or login using a Google account. Supabase handles the full OAuth flow.

**Flow:**

- New user (email not registered) → auto-creates account from Google profile → onboarding screen → dashboard.
- Returning user (email already registered) → links Google account to existing account → dashboard.

**Edge cases:**

- User dismisses Google popup → returns to login page, no error shown.
- Google-side auth failure → toast: "Google sign-in failed. Try again or use email and password."

---

#### 1.4 Forgot Password / Reset Password

Secure password reset via a time-limited email link generated by Supabase Auth.

**Key behaviours:**

- Reset link valid for 1 hour.
- Security: system always shows the same confirmation message regardless of whether the email is registered (prevents email enumeration).
- On successful reset → all existing sessions invalidated → user redirected to login page.

**Edge cases:**

- Expired link → error page with "Request a new reset link" button.
- Already-used link → "This reset link has already been used."
- New password < 8 chars → inline error.

---

### 2. Author Profiles

#### 2.1 Post-Registration Onboarding & Profile Setup

After email verification, new users complete a minimal 2-field screen before accessing the dashboard.

**Fields shown:** Display Name (pre-filled from registration name, editable), Profile Photo (optional, skip-able). Optional bio field shown with "You can add this later" hint.

**Key behaviours:**

- Display name left blank → system uses registered full name automatically.
- Photo upload failure → silent fallback to initials-based default avatar.

---

#### 2.2 Edit Author Profile

Logged-in users update their profile at any time from Settings → My Profile.

**Editable fields:** Display Name, Username (@handle), Bio (max 300 chars), Profile Photo, Expertise Tags (multi-select, max 10), Twitter/X handle, LinkedIn URL, GitHub handle, Personal Website URL.

**Edge cases:**

- Username already taken → inline error with suggested alternative.
- Username contains invalid characters (only letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores allowed) → inline error.
- Profile photo > 2MB → "Photo must be under 2MB."
- Photo wrong type → "Please upload a JPG, PNG, or WebP image."
- Bio > 300 chars → character counter turns red, save button disabled.
- Username change → `SlugChangedEvent` fired → `slug_redirects` row inserted → old `/author/[old-username]` 301-redirects to new username.

---

#### 2.3 Public Author Profile Page — `/author/[username]`

Every user has a public profile page accessible without login.

**Page content:**

- Profile photo, display name, `@username`, bio, expertise tags, social link icons.

**Edge cases:**

- No published blogs → "No published articles yet."
- All blogs archived → same empty state. Archived blogs never shown publicly.
- Username not found → custom 404 with "Back to Homepage."

- Schedule > 6 months ahead → soft warning: "Scheduling far in the future. Confirm?" with OK / Change Date.

---

- Build-in-Public milestone entries (see section 9).

**Edge cases:**

- Handle not found → 404: "Company not found." with "Back to Homepage."

**SEO:** OG tags auto-generated. Organization JSON-LD schema + BreadcrumbList schema. Page added to `sitemap.xml`.

### 5. RBAC & Permissions

#### 5.1 Role-Based Access Control — Full Permissions Matrix

See the [Roles & Permissions section](#roles--permissions-rbac) above for the full matrix and role acquisition rules.

**Implementation note:** `PermissionChecker` is a pure class with zero dependencies (no I/O, no DB calls). All RBAC rules live here exclusively. Every service method calls `permissionChecker.can*()` before any mutation. This class is fully unit-testable without mocking.

---

### 6. Tags & Topics

#### 6.1 Tag System — Create, Attach & Manage Tags

Tags are platform-wide keywords attached to blogs for discovery and filtering.

**Key behaviours:**

- Tags field in the blog editor: searchable multi-select dropdown showing existing approved tags.
- Select existing tag → added as chip. Maximum 5 tags per blog.
- Type a tag name not in the system → option shown: `+ Create "[tagname]"`. New tag created with `is_approved=false`.
- `is_approved=false` tags: functional immediately (blog can publish with them) but hidden from the tag suggestion dropdown.
- Smart duplicate suggestion: typing "js" when "javascript" exists → "Did you mean: javascript?"

**Edge cases:**

- 6th tag attempt → input blocked: "Maximum 5 tags per blog."
- Tag name > 50 chars → inline error.
- Selecting a NEW (unapproved) tag → tooltip: "New tags are reviewed by our team. Your blog will still publish with this tag."

---

#### 6.2 Auto-Generated Tag Pages — `/tag/[slug]`

Every tag used in any published blog automatically gets a public topic page.

**Page content:**

- Tag name as H1, description (admin-editable, or auto-placeholder if not set), total blog count.
- Companies using this tag: logo strip with links to company pages.
- All published blogs with this tag listed newest first.
- Related tags sidebar: tags most frequently co-occurring with this tag.

**Key behaviours:**

- Page auto-created when first blog using the tag publishes.
- Page added to `sitemap.xml` automatically.
- `blog_count` on the `tags` table is updated ONLY through event handlers — never via direct SQL.

**Edge cases:**

- Tag with only 1 blog → page still created. Shows "1 article."
- Tag page for a subsequently deleted tag → 301-redirects to `/explore` with "Tag not found" notice.

**SEO:** Meta title: `Best [Tag] Articles – Lorestack`. OG image auto-generated.

---

### 7. Public Discovery

#### 7.1 Public Homepage — `/`

Content-first homepage. Different experience for logged-out vs logged-in users.

**For logged-out visitors:**

- Hero section: platform tagline + two CTAs: "Explore Articles" (smooth-scrolls to content), "Start Writing – it's free" (→ Sign Up page).

**For logged-in users:**

- Personalized greeting + quick-action strip: "+ Write Blog", "View Drafts", "My Dashboard".

**Content sections (both audiences):**

1. **Featured Companies** — admin-curated, max 6 slots. Company card: logo, name, tagline, blog count. Click → company page.
2. **Trending This Week** — 6 blog cards sorted by view velocity. Each card: cover image, type badge, title, author + company, read time, publish date.
3. **Browse by Type** — horizontal scrollable row of article type filter pills. Clicking a pill filters the content below. URL updates: `/?type=case-study`.
4. **Trending Tags** — top 10 platform-wide tags this week as clickable pills → `/tag/[slug]`.
5. **Recent Deep Dives** — Architecture Deep Dives and Case Studies highlighted in a larger card layout.

**Edge cases:**

- Platform has fewer than 10 published blogs (fresh launch) → internal/seeded articles shown. No empty sections visible to public.
- Slow network → skeleton loaders shown for all content sections while data loads.

---

#### 7.2 Explore – Browse All Blogs — `/explore`

Filterable, sortable listing of all published blogs on the platform. Accessible to anyone without login.

**Default view:** All published blogs, newest first, infinite scroll or pagination.

**Filters:**

- Article Type (multi-select checkboxes)
- Tags (searchable multi-select)
- Company (searchable dropdown)
- Date Range: Last week / Last month / Last 6 months / All time

**Sort options:** Newest | Oldest

**Active filters** shown as dismissible chips below the filter bar. "Clear all filters" link shown when any filter is active.

**Each blog card:** cover image, type badge, title, author avatar + name, company name if any, publish date, read time, tag chips.

**Edge cases:**

- No results for applied filters → "No articles match your filters. Try adjusting them." + "Clear Filters" button.
- URL updates with active filters for shareability: `/explore?type=tutorial&tag=react`.

---

### 8. SEO & Auto-Generated Pages

#### 8.1 Blog Page SEO — Auto Meta Tags & OG Images

Every published blog gets full SEO metadata automatically. No manual work required to publish with good SEO.

**Auto-generated on publish (if not overridden by author):**

- Meta title: blog title, truncated to 60 chars if needed. Uses `seo_title_override` if author set one.
- Meta description: first 160 chars of summary or body. Uses `seo_desc_override` if author set one.
- OG image: auto-generated branded image (blog title + Lorestack logo + author name on gradient background) if no cover image uploaded.
- Twitter Card meta tags (`twitter:card = summary_large_image`).
- Open Graph tags: `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`, `og:type = article`.
- Article JSON-LD structured data: headline, author (Person schema), publisher (Organization schema), `datePublished`, `dateModified`.
- Canonical URL: `/blog/[slug]`.
- Blog URL added to `sitemap.xml` on publish. Removed on archive.

**Edge cases:**

- Author's custom SEO title > 60 chars → warning in editor: "Your SEO title may be truncated in search results."
- Custom meta description > 160 chars → warning: "Meta description may be truncated by search engines."

---

#### 8.2 Company & Author Page SEO

Company pages and author profile pages get SEO metadata and sitemap entries auto-generated on creation.

**Company page SEO (triggered by `CompanyCreatedEvent`):**

- Meta title: `[Company Name] – Engineering Stories on Lorestack`
- Meta description: company tagline + blog count
- OG image: composite of company logo + cover image with company name text
- JSON-LD: Organization schema (name, url, logo, sameAs social links) + BreadcrumbList
- `/company/[handle]` added to `sitemap.xml`

**Author page SEO (triggered by `AuthorProfileCreatedEvent`):**

- Meta title: `[Display Name] – Articles on Lorestack`
- Meta description: author bio snippet
- JSON-LD: Person schema (name, url, sameAs social links)
- `/author/[username]` added to `sitemap.xml`

**Edge cases:**

- Company handle change → old URL 301-redirects to new URL. `sitemap.xml` updated.
- Author username change → old URL 301-redirects to new URL. `sitemap.xml` updated.
- Both changes handled via `SlugChangedEvent` → `SlugChangedEventHandler` → `slug_redirects` row inserted + sitemap updated.

---

### 9. Build-In-Public Timeline

#### 9.1 Add Milestone to Company Timeline

Company Owner logs milestones, launches, and achievements to a public chronological timeline. Company Author cannot add milestones.

**Milestone form fields:**

- Date (date picker, defaults to today — future dates allowed with soft warning, no hard block)
- Milestone Type (required): `Launch` · `User Milestone` · `Infra Update` · `Funding` · `Feature Release` · `Bug Fixed` · `Partnership` · `Hiring` · `Experiment` · `Other`
- Headline (required, max 100 chars)
- Description (optional, max 500 chars, basic Markdown formatting supported)
- Impact Metric (optional, max 80 chars — e.g. "Reduced p99 latency 40%". Displayed as a highlighted chip.)

**Access:** Company Dashboard → Timeline → "+ Add Milestone". Appears as an inline form or quick modal — no new page navigation.

**Key behaviours:**

- On success: milestone immediately visible on public company page Timeline tab. Toast: "Milestone added."

**Edge cases:**

- Headline blank → inline error: "Headline is required."
- Future date selected → soft warning below date field. Milestone still saves.
- Description > 500 chars → character counter turns red, save blocked with inline error.

---

#### 9.2 View Company Timeline — Public

Visitors view the company's Build-in-Public journey on the Timeline tab of the company page. Accessible without login.

**Display:**

- Reverse chronological order (newest at top).
- Milestones grouped by month/year headers: "May 2026", "April 2026", etc.
- Each entry: milestone type icon (color-coded per type), date badge, headline in bold, optional description, optional impact metric as a highlighted chip.
- Each milestone has a direct, shareable anchor URL: `/company/[handle]#timeline-[id]`.
- "Share Timeline" button: copies a shareable link with OG preview.

**Edge cases:**

- No milestones added yet → "This company hasn't shared their journey yet."

**SEO:** Timeline entries are crawlable. They contribute to company page SEO via structured content.

### Tables Summary

| Table                 | Type                    | Purpose                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `users`               | Entity                  | Identity only. Mirrors Supabase `auth.users`.                            |
| `author_profiles`     | Entity (1:1 with users) | Public display data. Created at onboarding.                              |
| `companies`           | Aggregate Root          | Company profile. Governs memberships, invites, milestones.               |
| `company_memberships` | Join / RBAC             | Per-company role per user. `PermissionChecker` source of truth.          |
| `company_invites`     | Entity                  | Invite lifecycle. 7-day expiry. Creates membership on accept.            |
| `blogs`               | Aggregate Root          | Full blog state. `company_id` nullable for independent authors.          |
| `blog_tags`           | Join table              | Composite PK. Max 5 rows per blog (service-enforced, not DB).            |
| `tags`                | Entity                  | Platform-wide topics. `blog_count` denormalized via event handlers only. |
| `company_milestones`  | Entity                  | Build-in-Public timeline entries. Owner-only write access.               |
| `seo_metadata`        | Value Object            | Cached SEO output per entity. Polymorphic via `entity_type`.             |
| `slug_redirects`      | Entity                  | 301 redirect mappings when slugs/handles change. Append-only.            |

## Architecture Reference

### Layers

```
API Controllers             thin — validate, delegate, respond
        ↓ depends on abstractions only
Service Interfaces          DIP boundary — business layer never imports Supabase
        ↓ implemented by
Application Services        orchestrate domain logic + fire domain events
+ Event Handlers            react to events — all side effects decoupled here
        ↓ depends on abstractions only
Repository Interfaces       11 interfaces — services never touch Supabase directly
        ↓ implemented by
Infrastructure              Adapters + Repository Impls — only layer that imports Supabase
        ↓ operates on
Domain Entities             User, Company, Blog, Tag — pure state, no framework deps
Domain Events               BlogPublishedEvent, SlugChangedEvent, etc.
Enums                       BlogStatus, ArticleType, CompanyRole, etc.
```

### Design Patterns Used

| Pattern         | Applied To                                                            | Purpose                                                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repository      | All 11 entity tables                                                  | Decouple data access from business logic                                                    |
| Adapter         | `SupabaseAuthAdapter`, `SupabaseStorageAdapter`, `ResendEmailAdapter` | Business layer is provider-agnostic. Swap by replacing the adapter only.                    |
| Observer        | `IEventBus` + 6 event handlers                                        | Sitemap, SEO generation, tag counts never leak into core service logic                      |
| Policy          | `PermissionChecker`                                                   | All RBAC rules in one pure, testable class                                                  |
| Template Method | `ISEOService`                                                         | All `generateFor*()` methods share one pipeline; entity-specific steps override             |
| Strategy        | `ISlugService`                                                        | Entity-specific slug generation rules unified behind one interface                          |
| Factory         | `BlogFactory`                                                         | Centralises Blog construction defaults — no scattered `new Blog(...)` with varying defaults |

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision                                            | Reason                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `users` and `author_profiles` are separate tables   | SRP — identity ≠ display profile. Onboarding creates the profile separately after verification.                                     |
| `blogs.company_id` is nullable                      | Spec: company is optional. Independent authors are first-class citizens, not an edge case.                                          |
| `PermissionChecker` has zero I/O dependencies       | Fully unit-testable without any mocks. Single source of truth for all 4-role RBAC rules. No inline permission checks anywhere else. |
| `IAuthService` implemented by `SupabaseAuthAdapter` | Business logic never imports Supabase SDK. The entire auth provider is swappable by replacing one class.                            |
| `IEventBus` with dedicated event handlers           | `BlogService.publish()` never directly calls sitemap updates, tag count increments, or SEO generation. All decoupled via events.    |
| `BlogFactory`                                       | Prevents scattered `new Blog(...)` with inconsistent defaults across the codebase.                                                  |
| `slug_redirects` persisted to DB                    | Spec requires 301 redirects when slugs/handles change. Must survive server restarts.                                                |
| `seo_metadata` is a separate table                  | SRP — domain entities stay lean. SEO has its own lifecycle (event-triggered regeneration).                                          |
| `DiscoveryController` uses repos directly           | MVP read-only trade-off. Pure queries, zero business logic. **Fix in Complete Product: `DiscoveryService`.**                        |

---

## Architecture Notes & Known Trade-offs

These are documented trade-offs — not bugs. Each has a recommended fix for the Complete Product phase.

### ⚠ DiscoveryController accesses repositories directly

- **Problem:** `DiscoveryController` (homepage + explore page) uses `IBlogRepository`, `ICompanyRepository`, `ITagRepository` directly, bypassing the service layer.
- **Why acceptable in MVP:** Pure read-only queries with no business logic or state mutations.
- **Fix in Complete Product:** Introduce `DiscoveryService` with query composition, caching layer, and eventually personalization logic.

### ⚠ `tags.blog_count` is denormalized

- **Problem:** `blog_count` is a cached count column. If anything other than the designated event handlers writes to it, counts drift.
- **Hard rule:** This column MUST only be modified via `BlogPublishedEventHandler.incrementBlogCount()` and `BlogArchivedEventHandler.decrementBlogCount()`. Never with direct SQL updates.
- **Fix in Complete Product:** Add a periodic reconciliation job that recalculates counts from `blog_tags` and corrects any drift.

### ⚠ `InMemoryEventBus` is synchronous

- **Problem:** The MVP event bus executes all handlers synchronously in-process. A handler failure can fail the originating request.
- **Mitigation:** Each handler call is wrapped in try-catch. Failures are logged but not propagated to the caller.
- **Fix in Complete Product:** Replace with BullMQ (Redis-backed) or Supabase `pg_notify` for async, durable event processing.

### ⚠ `SitemapService` maintains in-memory state

- **Problem:** If the server restarts, the in-memory sitemap state is lost. The next incremental update will operate on a stale or empty base.
- **Mitigation:** `SitemapService.rebuild()` is called on server boot — reads all public entity slugs from the DB and reconstructs the sitemap from scratch.
- **Fix in Complete Product:** Always read `sitemap.xml` from Supabase Storage before each write. Eliminate in-memory state entirely.
